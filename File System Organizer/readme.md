> This being my fist NodeJs project is very handy and useful in real life to organize files in a directory. 😍

> I organized all my 100's of files in Downloads folder to respective folders such as apps,
documents, videos, pictures, archives, others etc.
through this project. 

> Looking forward to learn more of NodeJs features and implementing them to solve real world problems one after another. 😁
